# React + Vite

The project is a Movie Search Web Application developed using a robust stack of modern technologies including ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.

The frontend of the application features dynamic movie display and search functionalities powered by the tmdb movie database api.

Users can view popular movies, search for specific titles, and access detailed information including synopses, release dates, and cast details.

The application also includes a favorites management system that allows users to save and organize their preferred movies, and offers theme customization with options for dark and light modes.

On the backend, RESTful APIs developed with Express facilitate interactions between the frontend and the server.

These APIs handle movie data retrieval, user authentication, and favorites management, with secure user sessions managed using JWT and cross-origin requests enabled through CORS.

The project ensures a seamless and responsive user experience across various devices, emphasizing clean code, intuitive design, and efficient API integration.
